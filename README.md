# treehouse-course-java-functional-programming
After finishing a course of Treehouse.com about git and github, I have decided to practice the new git terminal commands I have just learned.
This project is from another course on Functional Programming in Java, where the teacher was showing us the difference between a declarative 
and an imperative approach.
I have create a new repository here on GitHub and I have set up the local folder on my hard drive to pull all the project here.
